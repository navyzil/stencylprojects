The primary difficult areas are the heavy drawing codes (which don't have to be understood to appreciate how the games work), working with a pseudo-2D list, and using the Image API. One of the best features of this demo though is to show you how you can use image instances as basically no-collision actors.

That said, there are a lot of comments, so if you have some Stencyl experience, the programming should make some sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Primary Features:&lt;br&gt;1.

	<resource id="101031" title="Demo- Explosions" name="Tuo" description="This is a short demo to show how to make rather realistic explosions based on where the mouse was pressed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a level 3 demo; the only real area I could see being tricky is the mathematics for the forces, but those are well-commented. The coding part is hopefully rather straightforward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Primary Features:&lt;br&gt;1. Making explosions (with a particle effect).&lt;br&gt;2. Having forces cause nearby actors to move away from the impact point.&lt;br&gt;3. Using an actor count attribute (including for killing off screen).&lt;br&gt;4. Having fun blowing crates up :P.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please do not simply use this in your game. My goal in creating it is to show others HOW to make things themselves.

	<resource id="101049" title="Demo- Infinite Climb" name="Tuo" description="This demo goes over how to make an infinite platformer that scrolls vertically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a level 3 difficulty, meaning that it is even suited for those who are just starting with Stencyl (although it might be a bit challenging if this is the first thing you try to learn).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NOTE: This contains two demos in one. There are multiple ways to make an infinite climbing platformer, and this goes over two of them. The &quot;OldLevel&quot; and &quot;OldPlatform&quot; use my methods from the 2.2 StencylForge demo. I simplified the coding for newcomers in the &quot;NewLevel&quot; and &quot;NewPlatform&quot;. Both demos use the same player actor though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Primary Features:&lt;br&gt;New Method:&lt;br&gt;     1. Using a game attribute to control several things at once.&lt;br&gt;     2. Using an actor attribute to create a simple infinite creation system.&lt;br&gt;Old Method:&lt;br&gt;     1. Using custom blocks to set an attribute.&lt;br&gt;     2. Using custom events as custom time loops.&lt;br&gt;      3. Setting attributes for multiple actors at once.&lt;br&gt;Both Methods:&lt;br&gt;      1. Making a truly infinite game.&lt;br&gt;     2. Scaling difficulty over time.&lt;br&gt;     3. Wrap-around player coding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please do not simply use this in your game.

There is a heavy emphasis on lists, drawing codes, and manipulations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Primary Features:&lt;br&gt;1. Using drawing codes to their utmost potential (since there are no actors).&lt;br&gt;2. Decent AI system.&lt;br&gt;3. Actorless buttons.&lt;br&gt;4. Using lists.&lt;br&gt;5.

Layering actors without using layers (as layers can be laggy).&lt;br&gt;2. Moving actors with the mouse.&lt;br&gt;3. &quot;Snapping&quot; actors into place, and then making them un-clickable.&lt;br&gt;4. Using custom blocks and custom events.&lt;br&gt;5.
