If you use an earlier build, it will not work!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This demo explains how to use the image API and z-ordering to drastically improve on my earlier jigsaw puzzle. You can now add new puzzle images with minimal effort, and there's now difficulty options. Everything is automated!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This demo is also rated at a difficulty level 6 (like the original). The primary difficult areas are the heavy drawing codes (which don't have to be understood to appreciate how the games work), working with a pseudo-2D list, and using the Image API. One of the best features of this demo though is to show you how you can use image instances as basically no-collision actors. Also, the cutting of an actor into pieces is rather cool ;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please do not simply use this in your game. My goal in creating it is to show others HOW to make things themselves.

The primary reason for the 6 is that everything in the game needs to be done custom... custom tiles, custom collisions, custom gravity, custom friction, tile API, etc. Everything needs to be work at ANY angle, which makes things a bit more challenging. That said, there are a lot of comments, so if you have some Stencyl experience, the programming should make some sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Primary Features:&lt;br&gt;1.

Wrap-around movement&lt;br&gt;3. Disappearing coins (and just a money system in general)&lt;br&gt;4. Actors that chase the player&lt;br&gt;5. Countdown loading screen&lt;br&gt;6. Simple use of a game attribute list&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please do not simply use this in your game. My goal in creating it is to show others HOW to make things themselves.
