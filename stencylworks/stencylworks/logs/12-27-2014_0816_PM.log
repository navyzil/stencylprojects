	<resource id="136872" title="Demo Updated Puzzle" name="Tuo" description="PLEASE NOTE: This demo requires build 7721 or later. If you use an earlier build, it will not work!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This demo explains how to use the image API and z-ordering to drastically improve on my earlier jigsaw puzzle. You can now add new puzzle images with minimal effort, and there's now difficulty options. Everything is automated!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This demo is also rated at a difficulty level 6 (like the original). The primary difficult areas are the heavy drawing codes (which don't have to be understood to appreciate how the games work), working with a pseudo-2D list, and using the Image API. One of the best features of this demo though is to show you how you can use image instances as basically no-collision actors. Also, the cutting of an actor into pieces is rather cool ;).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please do not simply use this in your game. My goal in creating it is to show others HOW to make things themselves. God blessed me with a brain for programming, so I am trying to use it to bless others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have a question, please visit my livestream (livestream.com/stencyl).

Attach it to all actors to be included in z ordering. The default implementation uses the bottom y coordinate of the actor as z order index. Modify it to suit you need. The block should return the z index of a actor as a number. Actors with higher values are drawn in front of actors with lower values. If you need different sorting criteria for different kinds of actors, duplicate the behavior and modify the copy as needed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This implementation doesn't move actors between layers, it changes drawing order of actors within layer. If you need certain actors to be always on top (elements of HUD, for example), create new layer, put it on top, and place those actors there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actors without Set Z Order Behavior will be placed at end of the drawing queue - thus they will appear on top of others." downloads="961" reviews="8" comments="7" rating="4.375" depends="107354,107355" type="pack" date="2013-09-21" private="f" featured="1" metadata="" license="1" preview="f" url="" />

The primary reason for the 6 is that everything in the game needs to be done custom... custom tiles, custom collisions, custom gravity, custom friction, tile API, etc. Everything needs to be work at ANY angle, which makes things a bit more challenging. That said, there are a lot of comments, so if you have some Stencyl experience, the programming should make some sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Primary Features:&lt;br&gt;1. Using the tile API to change tiles on the fly.&lt;br&gt;2. Using sensor objects to trigger events based on position.&lt;br&gt;3. Creating a custom gravity based on the direction of the player.&lt;br&gt;4. Creating a custom friction based on the location of the player.&lt;br&gt;5. Detecting when a collision is NOT happening.&lt;br&gt;6. Seeing the use of custom collisions (both actor and tile) [I couldn't really comment on HOW to do the custom collision.

I estimate that version to be level 6.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Primary Features:&lt;br&gt;1. Using the Tile API extension&lt;br&gt;2. Creating a game in which tiles can be used dynamically&lt;br&gt;3.

The coding part is hopefully rather straightforward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Primary Features:&lt;br&gt;1. Making explosions (with a particle effect).&lt;br&gt;2.
